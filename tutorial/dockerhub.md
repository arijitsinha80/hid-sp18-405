Apache Avro is a data serialization system, which provides rich data structures, remote procedure call (RPC), a container file to store persistent data and simple integration with dynamic languages~\cite{hid-sp18-405-tutorial-avro-doc}. Avro depends on schemas, which are defined with JSON. This facilitates implementation in other languages that have the JSON libraries. The key advantages of Avro are schema evolution - Avro will handle the missing/extra/modified fields, dynamic typing - serialization and deserialization without code generation, untagged data - data encoding and faster data processing by allowing data to be written without overhead.

The following steps illustrate using Avro to serialize and deserialize data with example modified from Apache Avro 1.8.2 Getting Started (Python)~\cite{hid-sp18-405-tutorial-avro-python}.

* The Avro Python library does not support code generation, while Avro used with Java supports code generation, see [Apache Avro 1.8.2 Getting Started (Java)](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/gettingstartedjava.html) for details
