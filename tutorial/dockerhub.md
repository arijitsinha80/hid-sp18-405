# Docker Hub

Min Chen (hid-sp18-405) 

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows users to link to code repositories, build their own images and test them, stores manually pushed images, and links to Docker Cloud so they can deploy images to their hosts~\cite{hid-sp18-405-tutorial-dockerhub}. It provides a centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution and change management, user and team collaboration, and workflow automation throughout the development pipeline.
