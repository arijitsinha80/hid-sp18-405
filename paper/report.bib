  abstract  = {Although many applications built on top of market-ready 
	ontology storages are generic and lack dependence on the particular 
	application domain, most users prefer applications tailored to their 
	particular task. Such applications are typically built using object-oriented 
	paradigm that accesses data differently than generic applications. In this 
	paper, we define a benchmark consisting of an ontology and ontological 
	queries tailored for testing suitability of ontological storages for 
	object-oriented access. We present results of experiments on several 
	state-of-the-art ontological storages and discuss their suitability for the 
	purpose of object-oriented application access.},
